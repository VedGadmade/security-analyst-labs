 Network Fundamentals

## Topics Covered
- What is a computer network
- Hosts, IP addresses, and networks
- Network devices:
  - Hub
  - Bridge
  - Switch
  - Router
- OSI model (practical perspective)
- OSI vs TCP/IP model mapping

## Key Understanding
- Networks enable communication between hosts using defined protocols
- Switches operate at Layer 2, routers at Layer 3
- OSI model helps understand where issues occur in network communication

## SOC Perspective
- Knowing device roles helps trace traffic flow during investigations
- OSI model assists in isolating network vs application-layer issues
- Misconfigured devices can lead to security gaps
